## Plant Seedlings Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks
This project is based on the use of convolutional neural networks in conjunction with techniques such as image
augmentation and transfer learning to differentiate between images of weeds and crop seedlings.

## Proposal
The proposal for this project can be found in the Proposal.pdf file

## Description of libraries

- The scikit-learn library also known as sklearn was used to calculate the F1 score of models.
- The matplotlib library was used for visualization of all plots and images within the project.
- The Keras library running on top of TensorFlow was use to implement all Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and Deep learning models.
